</p>

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's catalog of shows and movies using SQL and data visualization tools. The goal is to extract valuable insights from a large dataset (over 82,000 rows) to help Netflix and its stakeholders better understand content trends, audience preferences, and performance metrics.

## Project Overview
- **Data Source:** The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed information about Netflix's TV shows and movies, including titles, genres, release years, IMDB scores, age certifications, and more.
- **Technologies Used:**
  - **SQL (MySQL):** For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
  - **Excel:** For initial data exploration and preparation.
  - **Tableau:** For building interactive dashboards and visualizing key findings.

## Key Analyses Performed
- Identified the top and bottom 10 movies and shows based on IMDB scores.
- Analyzed the distribution of content across different decades.
- Explored the impact of age certifications on ratings and content availability.
- Determined the most common genres for both movies and shows.
- Created a Tableau dashboard for interactive exploration of the results.

## Dashboard
A Tableau dashboard visualizing the main findings is available:
